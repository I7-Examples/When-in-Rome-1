# When in Rome 1: Accounting for Taste

An Inform 7 Standard Example

## Description

Manhattan, May, 1954. 

The last few years, you've settled into a routine. You work at the bank, you go home, you occasionally have dinner with your mother. It is all acceptably ordinary.

One day a strange creature crosses your path, and disrupts the schedule entirely.

When in Rome is designed as a lunchtime game: there are five episodes, each of which may be played to a conclusion within about fifteen minutes.
