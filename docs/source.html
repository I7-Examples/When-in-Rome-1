<p><a name="note1"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note1ref">[1]</a>.  Here we introduce a different object from the one which will represent Esther most of the rest of the time, because she behaves quite differently from Esther in the rest of the game. It would be possible to use the same object, but the code would become more cumbersome.</span></p>
<p><a name="note2"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note2ref">[2]</a>.  This scene, unlike most others in the game, can repeat as necessary.</span></p>
<p><a name="note3"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note3ref">[3]</a>.  The 'action stack depth' allows for actions that can happen implicitly to be stacked together into a single sentence.</span></p>
<p><a name="note4"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note4ref">[4]</a>.  When we define any new action that we don't want to allow the character to do, we need to set it accordingly (because our persuasion rules are so open-ended).</span></p>
<p><a name="note5"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note5ref">[5]</a>.  Otherwise we will get the default 'you can only do that to something animate' response.</span></p>
<p><a name="note6"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note6ref">[6]</a>.  In general this should work; however...</span></p>
<p><a name="note7"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note7ref">[7]</a>.  During this period of the game, we want a number of minutes to elapse between moments, like a montage of brief scenes in a movie. In addition to indicating this in the description, we have the clock advance at a different rate.</span></p>
<p><a name="note8"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note8ref">[8]</a>.  We must define 'one visible thing' here because we want to be able to accept commands like SHOUT MARS TO THUGS when the thugs are not in the same room and not touchable.</span></p>
<p><a name="note9"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note9ref">[9]</a>.  Largely an expedient so that more topics will match in conversation, even if the player has used articles.</span></p>
<p><a name="note10"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note10ref">[10]</a>.   Because the player should not still be carrying the paint lid, the paper chart, etc., a week after the earlier scene.</span></p>
