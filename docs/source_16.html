<br>
This is the apology for trouble rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the girl is passive;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>'I'm so sorry,' says the girl. 'I see now that it wasn't your dog at all. And it was nice of you to try to rescue me.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Suicidal might be more accurate.'</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
This is the attempt to get handbag rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the girl can see the handbag and the girl does not carry the handbag, try the girl trying taking the handbag.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Instead of the girl trying taking the handbag when the handbag is delicious and the creature has the handbag:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The girl] reaches for [the handbag], but [the creature] shrieks horribly and pounds on your head and blocks off your air supply.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'May I suggest,' you whisper hoarsely, 'that getting this thing free of me might be a more immediate concern?'</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Report the girl trying taking the handbag:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The girl] reacquires the handbag, looking satisfied. 'Well, at least that's taken care of.' You stare at her indignantly as small but strong fingers grip your throat.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<br>
This is the noticing frantic creature rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>'It's waving at me,' she says, glancing past you at the thing on your back. 'It keeps gnashing its teeth and pointing to its belly.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Must be ulcers,' you remark.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'You think?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Could you find something more to feed it, please?' you say. 'Maybe it could be lured away with snacks.'</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the girl is passive.
<br>

<br>
This is the looking around pointlessly rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the girl is passive;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The girl] circles you, considering the situation. 'It's very strong,' she comments unhelpfully.</font>&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
This is the comes in peace rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the girl is passive;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>'Maybe it's not hostile,' says the girl. 'Maybe it comes in peace, and its message is just misunderstood.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'It seems to be trying to kill me,' you point out, in a hoarse voice.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Oh, it's not trying very hard,' she says. Which is not a great consolation.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'My sergeant was of the opinion,' you say, breathing with difficulty. 'That once someone had. A gun pointed at you. It was past the time. To ask his intentions.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>She goes still. 'You were in Korea?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Italy,' you say. 'I'm not that young.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>She nods. 'Yes, of course. I should have guessed.'</font>&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
This is the violence sometimes helps rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the girl trying attacking the creature.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
This is the initial siren rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the girl is passive;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Somewhere several hundred yards down the path there is a siren and flashing lights: the police and fire department do still exist, even if they are falling down on the job of containing mysterious [color of the creature] animals just at the moment.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Every turn during Getting handbag:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the girl is active
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through the Table of Scripted Actions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow task entry; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the girl is passive <font color=#404040>[which will happen if she succeeds in acting</font>]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make no decision;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
<br>

<br>
Every turn during Getting handbag:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the girl is active and a portable thing (called target) is in the location
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Strangulation is happening, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The girl] [if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds]tries to pull the animal off you again, but it is causing more harm than help[otherwise]goes to the edge of the path and shouts for help, but no one hears[end if].</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise try the girl trying taking the target;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the girl is active.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report the girl trying taking the key:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The person asked] picks up the key. 'Really, I'm more afraid of a person getting this...'</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
