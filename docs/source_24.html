<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'What do you think you're doing? They're very easily hurt!' exclaims one of them.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>

</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Yes, give him another chance.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>A third one: 'I don't think we should risk anyone with violent tendencies.' And this person glares at you ferociously, so that you feel wormlike.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'It's the war, you know,' says the first man. 'He was trained as a soldier; it does things to their attitudes.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Now, that's not fair--' '--happy to shoot members of their own species, why not aliens?' 'There's a difference between being happy and being willing--' '--defending their own people--' '--biological imperative to protect those most like themselves--'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>It's obvious that these men have had this argument many times. Before it goes too much further, the dark-suited one turns back to you and says, 'We're going to have to fail you. I'm truly sorry.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Biological imperative,' says the blond man, with a humorless smile.</font>&quot;;
