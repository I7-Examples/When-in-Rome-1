<br>

<br>
Some hair is a kind of body part. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>hair</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>hairdo</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>curls</font>&quot; as hair. One hair is part of every woman. A nose is a kind of body part. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>nose</font>&quot; as nose. One nose is part of every woman. The description of a nose is usually &quot;<font color=#000080>Turned up, in a way that looks a little annoyed.</font>&quot; Some eyes are a kind of body part. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>eye</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>eyes</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>eyelashes</font>&quot;  as eyes. Eyes is part of every woman.

<br>
 
<br>
Smelling a body part is impertinent behavior. Touching a body part is impertinent behavior. Tasting a body part is impertinent behavior. Smelling a woman is impertinent behavior.
