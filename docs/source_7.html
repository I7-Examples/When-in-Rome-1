<br>
Procedural rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the person asked is not the player, substitute the animal feeding rule for the can't eat unless edible rule.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Procedural rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the person asked is not the player, ignore the can't take people's possessions rule.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Instead of asking the creature to try doing something when the person asked is in a closed container:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>The creature watches your mouth move, fascinated, but it obviously cannot hear you.</font>&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Before printing the name of the creature:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a random chance of 1 in 4 succeeds
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is scaly, say &quot;<font color=#000080>scaly </font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is furry, say &quot;<font color=#000080>furry </font>&quot;; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[color of the creature] </font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>

<br>
Rule for printing the name of the creature:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds, say &quot;<font color=#000080>creature</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;<font color=#000080>Visitor</font>&quot;.
<br>

<br>
This is the animal feeding rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not delicious, stop the action.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
A person can be active or passive.
<br>

<br>
<font color=#404040>[After the creature trying doing something: now the creature is passive; continue the action.</font>]
<br>

<br>
Before someone trying taking something: change containment context to the holder of the noun.
<br>

<br>
Containment context is a thing that varies. 
<br>

<br>
Heart's desire is a thing that varies. Before someone trying taking something, change heart's desire to the noun.
<br>

<br>
Report the creature trying taking something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is in the containment context and the containment context is a container,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The creature] picks up [the noun], now it is in [the containment context].</font>&quot; instead;

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>
Report an acquisitive creature trying taking something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is in the containment context and the containment context is a container,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The creature] gleefully picks up [the noun] from [the containment context].</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The creature] [if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds][forcefully] [end if][if containment context is a container]extracts[otherwise]acquires[end if] [the noun] from [if containment context is the location]the floor[otherwise][the containment context][end if], then recounts its possessions: [number of things carried by the creature in words].</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report a fidgety creature trying inserting something into something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The creature] shoves [the noun] hastily into [the second noun].</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report an athletic creature trying inserting something into something:

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report someone trying inserting something into something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The person asked] [puts] [the noun] into [the second noun].</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
To say puts:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose a random row in the Table of Insertion Words;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[word entry]</font>&quot;.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>

<br>
Definition: a container is contaminated if the odor sensitivity of the creature is strong and it contains a stinky thing.
<br>

<br>
Before the hostile smart creature trying taking something which is not available when the creature can see a papery available thing (called the target): 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature can see the player, try the creature trying threatening the target for the noun  instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
A thing can be threatened or unthreatened. A thing is usually unthreatened.
<br>

<br>
Threatening it for is an action applying to two things. Threatening something for something is useless action.
<br>

<br>
Instead of the creature trying threatening an unthreatened thing for something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is threatened;
