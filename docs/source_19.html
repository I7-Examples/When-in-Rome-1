<p class="indent0"><span class="heading">st room in which cars were once assembled. It has obviously been derelict for some time, since most of the machinery has been stripped out. There remain only a couple of presses and lathes, which look too dangerous for someone so mechanically disinclined as yourself.</span></p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Since its automotive days, it has become a command center, or perhaps a library. Stacked on every available surface are printed materials: magazines, newspapers, movie pamphlets. A large bulletin board fills one wall.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">To the north is a smaller room which you would guess to be the foreman's base of operation.&quot;<span class="quote"> North from the Factory Floor is the Foreman's Area. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The machinery is scenery in the Factory Floor. Understand </span>&quot;presses&quot;<span class="quote"> and </span>&quot;press&quot;<span class="quote"> and </span>&quot;lathe&quot;<span class="quote"> and </span>&quot;lathes&quot;<span class="quote"> as the machinery. The description is </span>&quot;Large; heavy. This concludes your expertise in mechanics.&quot;<span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The printed materials are scenery in the Factory Floor. Understand </span>&quot;magazine&quot;<span class="quote"> or </span>&quot;magazines&quot;<span class="quote"> or </span>&quot;newspaper&quot;<span class="quote"> or </span>&quot;papers&quot;<span class="quote"> or </span>&quot;newspapers&quot;<span class="quote"> or </span>&quot;paper&quot;<span class="quote"> or </span>&quot;pamphlet&quot;<span class="quote"> or </span>&quot;pamphlets&quot;<span class="quote"> or </span>&quot;movie&quot;<span class="quote"> as the printed materials. The description of the printed materials is </span>&quot;You flip through the nearest pile: LIFE magazine from 1952 ('Are Flying Saucers Real?'); a number of issues of 'Astounding Stories'; pamphlet for 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'; some recent newspaper articles in French.&quot;<span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The large bulletin board is scenery in the Factory Floor. Understand </span>&quot;map&quot;<span class="quote"> and </span>&quot;maps&quot;<span class="quote"> and </span>&quot;picture&quot;<span class="quote"> and </span>&quot;pictures&quot;<span class="quote"> and </span>&quot;pin&quot;<span class="quote"> and </span>&quot;pins&quot;<span class="quote"> as the bulletin board. The description of the board is </span>&quot;On the board is a map of Manhattan with pins in it, and lines drawn, like a subway map, but not corresponding to any subway lines that actually exist. </p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The whole thing reminds you obliquely of field planning centers during the war.&quot;<span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Rule for listing nondescript items of the Factory Floor:</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">say </span>&quot;You've been left with &quot;<span class="quote">;</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">list the contents of the Factory Floor, as a sentence, tersely, listing marked items only, including contents and giving brief inventory information;</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">say </span>&quot;.&quot;<span class="quote"> </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The metal bar is a heavy thing in the Factory Floor. </span>&quot;A heavy bar of scrap metal sits on one of the newspaper piles, doing duty as a paperweight.&quot;<span class="quote"> Understand </span>&quot;paperweight&quot;<span class="quote"> or </span>&quot;scrap&quot;<span class="quote"> or </span>&quot;heavy&quot;<span class="quote"> as the metal bar. The description is </span>&quot;You've heard of these vertical-integration plants that can turn a lump of iron ore into an engine block in less than 24 hours. The metal bar appears to come from an early-ish phase of that process, refined into heavy steel but not shaped like an auto part yet.&quot;<span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The Foreman's Area is a room. </span>&quot;Elevated a few steps above the factory floor itself, this room must once have contained some office equipment or furniture: there are marks on the floor that suggest chairs and a desk, at the very least. But it has been cleared of all this.&quot;<span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"> </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Instead of going down in the Foreman's Area: try going south.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The cardboard box is in the Foreman's Area. It is a papery enterable container. It is openable and open. The description of the cardboard box is </span>&quot;It is about waist-high and roughly cubical. No clear sign of what used to be inside, though.&quot;<span class="quote"> </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The built-in counter is a supporter in the Foreman's Area. The description of the counter is </span>&quot;From the many ring-shaped stains and the odor of failed coffee experiments, you guess that this area has been serving as break-room and impromptu kitchen since the factory shut down. <span class="comment">[if something is on the counter]</span>It currently contains <span class="comment">[a list of things which are on the counter]</span><span class="comment">[otherwise]</span>It is bare at the moment<span class="comment">[end if]</span>.&quot;<span class="quote"> The counter is scenery.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The paint lid is a thing on the counter. It is stinky. The description of the paint lid is </span>&quot;The top announces it to be from a tin of Saddle Brown paint, and it must have been used relatively recently, because it still carries a pungent chemical odor.&quot;<span class="quote"> Before opening the paint: say </span>&quot;This is just the lid, anyway.&quot;<span class="quote"> instead.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The rubber ball is a thing. The description is </span>&quot;A red rubber ball, slightly chewed, much like the one favored by your dog Lloyd when you were a kid.&quot;<span class="quote"> Understand </span>&quot;red&quot;<span class="quote"> as the rubber ball. Instead of squeezing the ball, say </span>&quot;Pleasantly resilient.&quot;<span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The hood ornament is a medium-weight thing on the counter. The description of the hood ornament is </span>&quot;Oddly lonely without the rest of a car to go with it. It does have a moderate heft to it, though.&quot;<span class="quote"> </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The Chevrolet Passenger Car Shop Manual is a papery thing on the counter. The description of the manual is </span>&quot;The front cover reads: Chevrolet Passenger Car Shop Manual -- 1949-53 Models -- 1954 supplement -- RW-34-SM. Which will come in handy should you feel a sudden need to construct your very own automobile, but from its dusty and derelict air you get the sense that the suits are not expecting you to do any such thing.&quot;<span class="quote"> </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Rule for printing room description details of the cardboard box when the number of things contained by the box is 0: stop.
